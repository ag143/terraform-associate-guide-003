(insert tree diagram here)

1-notes.md <- cliff notes and questions from the Terraform resource
1-code.md <- coding exercises and examples
1-cards.md <- personal flashcards that will go into my [Anki](), some people find these personal and don't share them, as they are very tailored to the individual who made them, so take that as you will

## Motivation

I want to [study in public](). My motivation is twofold. Firstly, I believe I will be more fastidious in my writing if the results of my studying is out there in the open, and secondly I hope that this document can help somebody else wanting to pass the Terraform exam relatively quickly.
